- Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
- The first few numbers in the Fibonacci series look like this:
  - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
- Each number in the series (starting from the third number) is the sum of the two numbers immediately before it. 
  - For example, 2 is the sum of 1 and 1, 3 is the sum of 1 and 2, 5 is the sum of 2 and 3, and so on. 
- This pattern continues indefinitely, creating a unique sequence of numbers with many interesting mathematical properties.
